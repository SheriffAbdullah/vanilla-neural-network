# vanilla-neural-network

Two close yet unsuccessful attempts at coding a <b>vanilla neural network from scratch</b>, during my 3rd Semester at University (2022). 

If the following updates are done, I belive this code would work:
* Categorical cross-entropy instead of binary cross entropy.
* Proper learning rate initialisation and decay.
* Weight initialisation (from zero initialisation)
* Updating Softmax function (though it is not being used in the code, it is not correct).
